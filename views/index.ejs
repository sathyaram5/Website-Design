	<br><p>You may not know this, but most ice cream shops don't actually make their ice cream. They buy prepackaged containers or a pre-made mix in a large bag full of chemicals then just freeze the contents. Not at Niners Creamery.<br>
                        <br>Each of our recipes is made from scratch starting with a base of real cream and hand picked flavors. We never use any artificial syrups, fillers, preservatives, or food coloring. Because of this our flavors are always changing
                        and you get to experience new and exciting recipes on each visit.So come taste the difference and enjoy Charlotte's most unique ice cream.
                        <br>
